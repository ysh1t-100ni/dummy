## General Guidelines

- **Readability**: Write code that is easy to understand for others and your future self.
- **Modularity**: Break down large tasks into smaller, reusable methods and classes.
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each class and method should have one responsibility.
- **Avoid Duplication**: Do not repeat the same code; prefer reusability and abstraction.
- **Use Libraries Wisely**: Use third-party libraries that are stable, well-documented, and actively maintained.

## Naming Conventions

1. **Classes**: Use `PascalCase` for class names.
   - Example: `CustomerService`, `ProductManager`
   
2. **Methods**: Use `camelCase` for method names, starting with a verb.
   - Example: `getUserName()`, `calculateTotalAmount()`
   
3. **Variables**: Use `camelCase` for variables.
   - Example: `firstName`, `totalAmount`
   
4. **Constants**: Use `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` for constants.
   - Example: `MAX_RETRIES`, `PI`
   
5. **Interfaces**: Use `PascalCase` for interface names, and consider starting with "I" (optional, but common).
   - Example: `ILogger`, `IUserService`
   
6. **Packages**: Use lowercase letters with dot separators for package names.
   - Example: `com.example.projectname`
   
7. **Enums**: Use `PascalCase` for enum names and their constants.
   - Example: 
     ```java
     public enum Status {
         ACTIVE, INACTIVE, PENDING
     }
     ```

## Code Structure

- **Organize by Functionality**: Group related classes, interfaces, and enums together in appropriate packages.
- **Avoid Long Classes**: Keep class size manageable; ideally, a class should fit in a single screen.
- **Avoid Large Methods**: Methods should be concise (usually under 20 lines). Split long methods into smaller ones.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Use layered architecture (e.g., Controller, Service, Repository) to separate concerns and improve maintainability.

## Formatting and Indentation

- **Indentation**: Use 4 spaces for indentation (no tabs).
- **Line Length**: Keep line length to 100-120 characters.
- **Blank Lines**: Use blank lines to separate logical sections within methods and between methods.
- **Braces**: Always use braces for loops, if statements, and other control structures, even for single statements.
  ```java
  if (condition) {
      // do something
  }
