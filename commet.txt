"Engineering Roadshow: Where stickers get printed, photobooths get DIY’d, and surprise video editing skills emerge! 🎬😎 My team and I went all in – we made sure everyone had a blast while secretly being the backstage wizards. From creating a photobooth to capturing hilarious moments (you’re welcome, everyone 😄), it was a day full of memories! Also, fun fact: no one knew I had video editing superpowers... until now! 💪🏼🤫 Let's just say I might be the unsung hero of the event. Thanks for the amazing vibes and goodie chance! 🍀 #EngineeringRoadshow 


"Had an amazing time at the Engineering Roadshow! 🎉 My team and I worked hard behind the scenes to make it unforgettable— from printing stickers to creating a DIY photobooth, we were all in! 📸✨ I also got the chance to capture some awesome moments and edit videos, which was a fun surprise for everyone (didn't know I had those skills 😄). It's always great to be a part of such a creative and energetic event. Thanks for the opportunity to contribute, and I can't wait for the next one! #EngineeringRoadshow #Teamwork #BehindTheScenes #GoodieTime"
